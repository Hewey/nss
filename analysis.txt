I hope that you will forgive the lateness of this. I am one of only 2 technicians for a local pc repair shop and because of that have been working at lot more as buisness has ramped up. I'm still trying to find a balance with my schedule.

Now that I have said that my short analysis. One thing I learned from this assignment was a better way to look at the logs I had trouble with last week. Bash really helped out as I could then sort through them and find only the unique ips. One of the things I noticed with the IPs locations was that there seemed to be quite a few coming from sweden. There also where quite  a few from the west cost from places in California and washington.
